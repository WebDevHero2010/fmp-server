# Food Manager Pro - Node.js Backend Server

Food manager pro is a managment solution for health departments
where they can save facility and inspection information all from a web interface. This is the server where all of the
endpoints are accessed and interacts with a postgresql database.

## Lessons Learned

Building out the entire server backend taught me quite a bit. I learned about DB associations so I was able to implement
relationships with different models. I also learned about using different kinds of queries to reterive specific data as well
which was very useful.
